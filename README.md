    The main user of the game is myelf. I wanted to make a game based on The Legend of Zelda. Although not everything I wanted implemented was put into the game, I'm still quite satisifed with what I do have. I wanted to make thise game because Zelda is one of my favorite video games series, And I also wanted it to be fun for those who do not know much of the series.

    What was an orginal goal of mine was to use a point counter system. But that did not plan out as I had hoped. Also, selecting the right/wrong answer did not come to pass as of the games current version. I'll have to turn that into a stretch goal. But my biggest hurdle by far was the JS. Getting the questions to render on screen and getting the others to render when a previous question is answered.
