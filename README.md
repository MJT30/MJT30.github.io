The main user of the game is myelf. I wanted to make a game based on The Legend of Zelda. 
Although not everything I wanted implemented was put into the game, I'm still quite satisifed with what I do have. 
I wanted to make thise game because Zelda is one of my favorite video games series, 
And I also wanted it to be fun for those who do not know much of the series.

# Unsolved problems
 Selecting the right/wrong answer did not come to pass as of the games current version. 
 I'll have to turn that into a stretch goal. But my biggest hurdle by far was the JS. 
 Getting the questions to render on screen and getting the others to render when a previous question is answered.
