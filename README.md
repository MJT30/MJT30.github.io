# Zelda-Trivia

I am creating a Zelda trivia game. I want it to be playable by casual and hardcore fans alike. 
I will be using mt game design knowledge to help me with the game. The gameplay loop will be simple. No need to make it complicated. It will be sort of like who wants to be a millionaire. In terms of setup. 10 - 15 questions max. You still aren't that great with JS so be kind to yourself and allow yourself to learn and make mistakes during the process. 

Prompts need to come up when you get a right/wrong answer. 

You will gain points for a right answer, but you will lose points for an inncorrect answer. 
Point system. User will start with "X" amount of points. I'm still working on this part. 

Questions need to change every round. This can be acomplished with a function.
