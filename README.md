# Zelda-Trivia

I am creating a Zelda trivia game. I want it to be playable by casual and hardcore fans alike. 
I will be using mt game design knowledge to help me with the game. The gameplay loop will be simple. No need to make it complicated. It will be sort of like who wants to be a millionaire. In terms of setup. 10 - 15 questions max. You still aren't that great with JS so be kind to yourself and allow yourself to learn and make mistakes during the process. 

Prompts need to come up when you get a right/wrong answer.
